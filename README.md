# Loading-Bay-Dashboard
This evaluation sets the mark as my first programming project. The project was completed within 3 days of its initial proposal and it required me to create the front-end (using React) for a Loading Bay Dashboard. The dashboard is quite light-weighted, has an eye-pleasing design and comprises of an extensive use of animations.
